    Headers, macros and two-step compilation: avoiding 2000-line files
    [Part 1: Headers and macros]
tags: PRO2
---

Yesterday we had our first PRO2 lab session. To my surprise, we didn't use
[classes][OOP-classes], but we used another (related) new and mostly
unexplained feature: splitting our code into several files.

When we did [classes][OOP-classes], we divided the class into a _declaration_,
or what it does, and a _definition_, or how it does it, and we had a file
which ended up in something like this:

```c++
// DECLARATION
class Student {
private:
    int id;
    double grade;
    bool _has_grade;

    static const double MAX_GRADE = 10;
public:
    // Constructor
    Student(int id);
    Student(int id, double grade);

    // Getters
    int get_id() const;
    bool has_grade() const;
    double get_grade() const;

    // Setters
    void set_id(int id);
    void set_grade(double grade);
    void clear_grade();

    // Static getters
    static double get_max_grade();
};

// DEFINITION
Student::Student(int id) {
// ...
}

int main() {
    // ...
}
```

And thus we have an 80-odd file with:
- a class
- an incomplete main (I didn't implement any functional main in the last post)

Usually non-trivial programs consist of several classes a working main. This
can quickly lead to a file with a couple hundred lines. While somewhat unwieldy,
you can probably survive. [GCC][GCC] (the compiler which provides `g++`) v7.3.0
contains about 14 million lines of source code, and the [Linux kernel][Kernel],
20 million[^stats].
You can not create a single file with this size, for two reasons:

1. Do you want to fix something? Even if you know where in the program is the
    bug, you still have to locate it in the file.
2. Editors usually load the whole file into memory, but you will need
    loads of memory to open these files. In fact, most editors would simply
    die trying to load them. The same goes for compilers or other programs.

So how do we divide our source? Well, we first decide how the program should
be divided. If you have classes, usually a class in each file makes sense. Note
that, unlike other languages (Java, for example), it is not required.
Generally, put related things together.

So we've decided that we will have one file with the main and another with
the class `Student`. Let's do that: (the first line indicates which file is it)
```c++
// main.cc
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int id;
    cin >> id;
    Student s(id);
    cout << s.get_id();
}
```
```c++
// student.cc
// No need for #include <iostream> because we don't use cin/cout
// and no using namespace std; because we don't use cin/cout or vector or
// anything like this.
class Student {
private:
    int id;
    double grade;
    bool _has_grade;

    static const double MAX_GRADE = 10;
public:
    // Constructor
    Student(int id);
    Student(int id, double grade);

    // Getters
    int get_id() const;
    bool has_grade() const;
    double get_grade() const;

    // Setters
    void set_id(int id);
    void set_grade(double grade);
    void clear_grade();

    // Static getters
    static double get_max_grade();
};

Student::Student(int id) {
    this->id = id;
    this->_has_grade = false;
    this->grade = 0; // Dummy value
}

Student::Student(int id, double grade) {
    this->id = id;
    if (grade > Student::MAX_GRADE) {
        this->_has_grade = false;
        this->grade = 0;
    } else {
        this->_has_grade = true;
        this->grade = grade;
    }
}

int Student::get_id() const {
    return this->id;
}

bool Student::has_grade() const {
    return this->_has_grade;
}

double Student::get_grade() const {
    if (not this->_has_grade)
        return -1; // ERROR
    return this->grade;
}

void Student::set_id(int id) {
    this->id = id;
}

void Student::set_grade(double grade) {
    if (grade > Student::MAX_GRADE)
        return;
    this->_has_grade = true;
    this->grade = grade;
}

void Student::clear_grade() {
    this->_has_grade = false;
}

double Student::get_max_grade() {
    return Student::MAX_GRADE;
}
```

Okay, let's compile it. Since we have two files, we have to pass them both to
th compiler:
```sh
$ g++ -o student.x main.cc student.cc
main.cc: In function ‘int main()’:
main.cc:8:5: error: ‘Student’ was not declared in this scope
     Student s(id);
     ^
main.cc:9:13: error: ‘s’ was not declared in this scope
     cout << s.get_id();
             ^
```

Yes, we didn't think of that: the compiler actually compiles the two files
separately and then joins them (for how, see the next section), so although
the definition can be in a separate file, the _declaration_ (i.e.: the
`class Student {...}`) must be in the `main.cc` **and** in the `student.cc`,
because `student.cc` also references the `Student` class. Although copy-paste
may be tempting here, it has a flaw: if we want to change the declaration (for
example, to add a new method), we have to change it in **all** the files where
we pasted. Not a good idea, after all. Instead, C++ has a way to deal with this:
let the compiler do the copy-paste automatically.

First, let's create a new file with only the declaration. It is usually
ended with `.hh` (the original C files were `.c` and `.h`, so C++ files are
`.cc` and `.hh` or `.cpp` and `.hpp`. We use the first convention). This file
is called a _header_.

```c++
// student.hh
class Student {
private:
    int id;
    double grade;
    bool _has_grade;

    static const double MAX_GRADE = 10;
public:
    // Constructor
    Student(int id);
    Student(int id, double grade);

    // Getters
    int get_id() const;
    bool has_grade() const;
    double get_grade() const;

    // Setters
    void set_id(int id);
    void set_grade(double grade);
    void clear_grade();

    // Static getters
    static double get_max_grade();
};
```
```c++
// main.cc
#include <iostream>
#include "student.hh" // <!

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int id;
    cin >> id;
    Student s(id);
    cout << s.get_id();
}
```
```c++
// student.cc
#include "student.hh" // <!

Student::Student(int id) {
    this->id = id;
    this->_has_grade = false;
    this->grade = 0; // Dummy value
}

Student::Student(int id, double grade) {
    this->id = id;
    if (grade > Student::MAX_GRADE) {
        this->_has_grade = false;
        this->grade = 0;
    } else {
        this->_has_grade = true;
        this->grade = grade;
    }
}

int Student::get_id() const {
    return this->id;
}

bool Student::has_grade() const {
    return this->_has_grade;
}

double Student::get_grade() const {
    if (not this->_has_grade)
        return -1; // ERROR
    return this->grade;
}

void Student::set_id(int id) {
    this->id = id;
}

void Student::set_grade(double grade) {
    if (grade > Student::MAX_GRADE)
        return;
    this->_has_grade = true;
    this->grade = grade;
}

void Student::clear_grade() {
    this->_has_grade = false;
}

double Student::get_max_grade() {
    return Student::MAX_GRADE;
}
```

(I marked the interesting lines with `// <!`)

You may have seen that `#include`s like `#include <iostream>` are kind of... off.
They do not seem C++. Indeed, they are not C++ statements. `#include`s and
anything starting with a `#` is a "preprocessor directive" that the compiler
treats different (more on that later). In this case `#include` means "copy this
file here". The advantage over manual copying is that if we want to make a
change, we just have to edit the header, and when recompiling the rest, the
compiler will pull the new change from the header. Include has two syntaxes:

- `#include <x>`, where `x` is a system header. System headers are given to us
    by C++ or installed libraries. Examples of C++ headers are `iostream`,
    `vector` or `algorithm`. They do not need `.hh`.
- `#include "file"`, where `file` is the path to the file that we want to
    include, usually ending in `.hh` or similar. Note that I said path: if
    the file you want to include is, for example, in the parent dir, we would
    write `#include "../whatever.hh"`.

As a matter of convention, usually the declarations of `x.hh` are defined in
`x.cc`, and the only include in `x.cc` must be `#include "x.hh"`. Any other
includes should be in `x.hh` (exceptions may apply if you know what you are
doing), otherwise you may have problems to compile.

## The problem with duplicate headers

Note that `#include` is recursive: let us assume the following files:
```c++
// main.cc
#include "complex.hh"
#include "b.hh"

int main() {
    // Do something with Complex
}
```
```c++
// complex.hh
class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
```
```c++
// f.hh
#include "complex.hh"

// A function that does... something
Complex f(Complex h);
```

(Contents of `complex.cc` and `f.cc` are irrelevant)

Let's try to compile it:
```sh
$ g++ main.cc
In file included from f.hh:1:0,
                 from main.cc:15:
complex.hh:1:7: error: redefinition of ‘class Complex’
 class Complex {
       ^
In file included from main.cc:14:0:
complex.hh:1:7: error: previous definition of ‘class Complex’
 class Complex {
       ^
```

What? Why? One of the first things the compiler does is, among other things,
removing the comments and solving the `#include`s. We can see which is the
result of this with `g++ -E main.cc` (this will be explained later):
```c++
# 1 "main.cc"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "main.cc"
# 1 "complex.hh" 1
class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
# 2 "main.cc" 2
# 1 "f.hh" 1
# 1 "complex.hh" 1
class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
# 2 "f.hh" 2


Complex f(Complex h);
# 3 "main.cc" 2

int main() {

}
```

(Ignore the `# (n)`: these are there to help the compiler)

As we see, for the compiler, `Complex` has been defined twice, and that's not
valid. Instead, we have two ways to fix this: the easy and the "official".

### The easy fix

(**WARNING**: This is forbidden in PRO2, if you just want to pass PRO2, skip
to the next subsection, this one is only for context)

The easiest way to fix this is to change the `.hh` files: (The new lines are
the ones with `// <!`)

```c++
// complex.hh
#pragma once // <!

class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
```
```c++
#pragma once // <!

#include "complex.hh"

// A function that does... something
Complex f(Complex h);
```

If we now try again `g++ -E main.cc`:
```c++
# 1 "main.cc"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "main.cc"
# 1 "complex.hh" 1
       

class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
# 2 "main.cc" 2
# 1 "f.hh" 1
       




Complex f(Complex h);
# 3 "main.cc" 2

int main() {

}
```

Indeed, `complex.hh` is included only once. That's explains the "once" in
`#pragma once`. What's the `pragma` part? Well, that's the part that explains
why this is not the official way: all compilers must support `#include` and
a few other directives, and (in theory) if they want to add their own, they
add it as a `pragma`. If another compiler does not support it, it will simply
ignore that line. That's why `#inclued` will raise an error, but `#pragma onec`
won't.

In practice almost all C and C++ compilers support `#pragma once`, including:
- GCC / G++
- Clang / Clang++
- MSVC / MSVC++ (Microsoft's compiler)
- Other compilers you've probably never heard of, like:
    * ICC (Intel's compiler)
    * Oracle's compiler

Then, why isn't it in the C++ standard? Well, presumably, the C++ Standard
Committee is waiting for modules, a functionality which will replace `#include`
in C++ (hopefully), expected for <s>C++11</s> <s>C++14</s> <s>C++17</s> some day.
Meanwhile, the C Standard Committee, which would never implement modules
(because that's against the idea of making C simple for compilers) is waiting
for... divine inspiration.

However it is, the "official" way and the one you **must** use in PRO2 is...

### The "official" fix

This relies on a couple of mechanisms which I will explain later, let's first
see how we have to edit the headers (additions marked with `// <!`):

```c++
// complex.hh
#ifndef _COMPLEX_HH // <!
#define _COMPLEX_HH // <!

class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
#endif // _COMPLEX_HH // <!
```
```c++
// f.hh
#ifndef _F_HH // <!
#define _F_HH // <!

#include "complex.hh"

// A function that does... something
Complex f(Complex h);
#endif // _F_HH // <!
```

!?

Don't panic, let's go step by step.

**Note**: The following is work and magic of the C/C++ preprocessor (CPP from
now on). It is a powerful tool when used with care and not abused. It can be
used for both C and C++, because (as I will explain later) nothing is
C++-specific, and some examples will be in C because, after all, the CPP was
invented for C, and it makes more sense with C.

**Tip**: This works and is the approved way of doing this. The following
sections explain why does this work. If you are not interested, you are directed
to go to the end of the post.

#### `#define`: Macros

One of the "advantages" (when used with care) of having a preprocessor is
that you can turn developer-friendly code into compiler-friendly code.

The CPP allows you to create "compile-time constants" (called _macros_), which
will be substituted at the same time as `#include`s are processed (we call this
_preprocessing_).

For example, let's say that you have a C program and want to create a string
constant. This is somewhat tricky in C, so instead we do this:

```c
/* example.c */
#include <stdio.h> /* Equivalent to <iostream> */
#define MY_CONSTANT "qwerty"


int
main ()
{
    printf("%s\n", MY_CONSTANT); /* Equivalent to cout */
    printf("\n"); /* Equivalent to cout << endl */
    printf("%s\n", MY_CONSTANT);
}
```

(I know this is a bad example, I couldn't think of anything better)

If we preprocess it with `gcc -E example.c`:
```c
# 1 "example.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "example.c"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4

/* ... About 800 lines from stdio.h later ... */

# 5 "example.c"
int
main ()
{
    printf("%s\n", "qwerty");
    printf("\n");
    printf("%s\n", "qwerty");
}
```

That's right: it has been replaced dumbly. Every time the CPP sees the constant,
it gets replaced with its value.


Another example, this time with macro functions:

```c
/* example.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#define SQUARE(x) ((x)*(x))

int
main ()
{
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num); /* Equivalent to cin */
    int square = SQUARE(num);
    printf("%d\n", square);
}
```

`gcc -E example.c`:

```c
# 1 "example.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "example.c"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4

/* The same 800 lines than before */

# 4 "example.c"
int
main ()
{
    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    int square = ((num)*(num));
    printf("%d\n", square);
}
```

(If you're wondering why all those parenthesis, remember that it does dumb
substitution, imagine for what it would substitute `SQUARE(num+1)` or
`10/SQUARE(num)`)

You can do more really interesting things with macros, all outside the scope
of this explanation. If you are curious, remember: Google is your friend.

**Warning**: You must **NOT** use the CPP in this way in PRO2, this is here
as an explanation, but it usually is a bad practice and you will fail PRO2
if you do it. I've warned you. NEVER use this. NEVER. Until you have
a few years of experience in C/C++.

#### `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`... Conditional compilation

Sometimes, you simply do not care about the value of a macro, but simply
whether is defined, and, if it is (not), execute a piece of code. For example,
if the `MUL_TRIPLE` macro is defined, we will use `3*x`. Otherwise, `x+x+x`:
```c
#ifdef MUL_TRIPLE
int
triple (int x)
{
    return 3 * x;
}
#else
int
triple (int x)
{
    return x + x + x;
}
#endif
```

We can define macros on compilation with `-D`, so let's see:

`gcc -E -DMUL_TRIPLE example.cc`
```c
# 1 "example.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "example.c"

int
triple (int x)
{
    return 3 * x;
}
```

`gcc -E example.cc` (no `MUL_TRIPLE`):
```c
# 1 "example.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "example.c"







int
triple (int x)
{
    return x + x + x;
}
```

As a tip, you can use `#if`, which evaluates conditions (if you want more
info, search for "C conditional compilation" in Google). If you put `#if 0`,
you can comment large chunks of code easily (in fact, most editors signal
`#if 0`...`#endif` as comments instead of their usual meaning):
```c
#if 0
int
triple (int x)
{
    return 3 * x;
}
#endif

int
quadruple (int x)
{
    return 4 * x;
}
```

### Summing this up: include guards

Finally, we can understand the pattern:

`#ifndef` is the opposite of `#ifdef`: it only includes a chunk of code if the
macro is not defined.

```c++
#ifndef _COMPLEX_HH
#define _COMPLEX_HH

class Complex {
public:
    double re;
    double im;

    double module() const;
    double angle() const;
};
#endif // _COMPLEX_HH
```

The first time the file is included, `COMPLEX_HH` will not defined, so we
define it and continue with the rest of the header. The following times,
`COMPLEX_HH` will already be defined, so the content of the header will
be skipped.

Finally, a couple remarks:
- The name of the macro does not have to be the file name with `_`
    instead of `.`, but it must be consistent between the `#ifndef` and
    the `#define`, and unique within the project. It is also recommended
    that it begins with an underscore, because a C++ identifier (name of
    variable, class, etc.) can't (well, shouldn't) start with a `_`.
- The comment with the macro name next to the `#endif` is not required, but
    it is generally considered good practice.

Since we're talking about splitting source files, and this post was getting
rather long (about 800 Markdown lines), I decided to split it too: [Read the
second part][Headers 2].

Footnotes:

[^stats]: This statistics may not be up to date (specially the GCC one). I
    wanted to count them, but the GCC project has 74853 files (v7.3.0), so after
    an hour of counting with `cloc`, I decided to give up and google it. I
    didn't even attempt to count the Linux kernel.
